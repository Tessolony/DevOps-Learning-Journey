# Git Branching Concepts.

## What is Git Branching? - Branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase - It helps maintain a structured workflow and enables collaboration.

## Types of Branches  
- Main (`main`) → Stable branch with production-ready code.  
- Feature Branches → New feature development before merging into `main`.  
- Bug Fix Branches → Quick patches for issues in production.  
- Release Branches → Prepares for a stable deployment.  
- Hotfix Branches → Urgent fixes applied directly in production.  

##  Common Git Branching Commands  

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-login-ui  

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature-login-ui  

# Merge changes into main
git checkout main
git merge feature-login-ui  

# Delete a branch (after merging)
git branch -d feature-login-ui  


Best Practices
-Use clear branch names (feature-login-ui instead of new-branch)
-Commit frequently to keep track of changes.
- Merge branches regularly to avoid conflicts.
- Delete unused branches once merged to keep things clean.
